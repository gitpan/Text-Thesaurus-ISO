====================

Introduction
------------

This module is intended to support the using of ISO thesaurus files 
from Perl scripts.  It allows rapid access to individual thesaurus
records based on the terms that they cover and also provides routines
to allow individual items in the thesaurus record to be retrieved.  This
code has been developed as part of the ROADS project but is being made
available separately as it is felt that it may be more widely applicable.

Installation
------------

Retrieve the latest release from one of the archive sites worldwide
or from <URL:ftp://ftp.roads.lut.ac.uk/pub/ROADS/contrib/
Text-Thesaurus-ISO.latest.tar.gz> 
and uncompress/untar the resulting file using:

  unzip -c Text-Thesaurus-ISO.latest.tar.gz | tar xvf -

This will create a directory called Text-Thesaurus-ISO-x.y, where
"x.y" is the version number of the release.  Change to this directory
and you install the module by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install

Please report any bugs/suggestions to <roads-liaison@bristol.ac.uk>

Usage
-----

The module contains a complete POD set embedded in the code.  This can
be processed with any of the normal POD processing tools, for example:

  perldoc Text::Thesaurus::ISO
